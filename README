This is a learning purpose java project (thanks to scoroi)
It does nothing but synchronize files/folders on the same machine

to run it, the config file (config.xml) should be prezent in the same folder as "jSynch.jar" program

program support command line parameters

        Use java -jar jSynch.jar [-h ][-level TRACE|INFO|ERROR|FATAL|NONE]
            -h                                        : show this help;
            -level TRACE|INFO|ERROR|FATAL|NONE        : set the LogLevel to the specified one;
        This LogLevel is overridden by the config value (if any).
        Config.xml file should be located in the same folder as the jSynch.jar file.
           Thank you for choosing us.
