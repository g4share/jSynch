This is a learning purpose java project (thanks to scoroi)
It does nothing but synchronize files/folders on the same machine



Desktop client supports folowing command line parameters:

  Use java -jar jSynch.jar [-h ]
                           [-stat]
                           [-home {home folder}]
                           [-level TRACE|INFO|ERROR|FATAL|CRITICAL|NONE]
                           [-env PRODUCTION|DEVELOPMENT
      -h                                        : show this help;
      -stat                                     : get status info;
      -home                                     : home folder (location where config file is located);
      -env                                      : set the environment;
      -level TRACE|INFO|ERROR|FATAL|NONE        : set the LogLevel to the specified one;
             This LogLevel overrides the config value (if any).
             Config.xml file should be located in the same folder as the jSynch.jar file.
  Thank you for choosing us.
